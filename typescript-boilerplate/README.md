# TypeScript SDK Boilerplate

This directory contains the boilerplate code used by Sideko to generate TypeScript SDKs. The code here provides the foundation that Sideko's generator builds upon to create complete, production-ready SDK clients.

## Directory Structure

### Core (`./core/`)
Contains utility code for core SDK functionality:
- Fetch wrapper implementations
- Environment handling (browser vs. different backend runtimes)
- Authentication handlers
- Response type handling
- Error management

### GitHub Actions (`./github_actions/`)
CI/CD workflow templates for:
- Running the autogenerated tests
- Publishing to npm
- Type checking
- ESLint verification

### Package Configuration (`./pkg/`)
Files related to package management and git:
- `package.json` template
- tsconfig settings
- jest settings (testing framework)
- Git configuration
- Publishing configuration

### Resource Templates (`./resource/`)
Boilerplate for individual API resource clients:

```typescript
export class SidekoResourceClient extends CoreResourceClient {
  constructor(client: CoreClient) {
    super(client);
  }
}
```

These base classes are transformed during generation:
- Classes are renamed based on your configuration
- Methods are added based on API endpoints
- Types are generated from schemas

### Source (`./src/`)
Base SDK structure including:
- Client initialization
- Configuration interfaces
- Resource client management
- Type definitions with Zod
- Constants like server URLs

## Code Generation

The code in this repository is intentionally incomplete. During generation:
1. Sideko analyzes your API specification
2. Classes and methods are renamed according to configuration
3. API-specific code is injected
4. Types are created and linked

### Customization Points

The boilerplate includes strategic points where Sideko injects generated code:
- Resource class names (e.g., `SidekoResourceClient` â†’ `PetsClient`)
- Method signatures based on endpoints
- Interface definitions from schemas
- Authentication method implementations
- API-specific configuration types

## Usage

This code is not meant to be used directly. Instead:
1. Use Sideko's API to generate your SDK
2. The generator will use this boilerplate as a foundation
3. Your API-specific code will be added automatically
4. The result will be a complete, typed SDK

## Contributing

While this is primarily boilerplate code, we welcome:
- Bug reports for the base structure
- Improvements to utility functions
- Documentation enhancements
- Suggestions for better TypeScript patterns
